tempdisagg: Methods for Temporal Disaggregation and Interpolation of Time Series
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Temporal disaggregation methods are used to disaggregate low frequency time series to higher frequency series, where either the sum, the average, the first or the last value of the resulting high frequency series is consistent with the low frequency series. Temporal disaggregation can be performed with or without one or more high frequency indicator series. The R package tempdisagg is a collection of several methods for temporal disaggregation. 

To install or update from from [CRAN][package], run:

    install.packages("tempdisagg")

Our [article in the R-Journal][article] describes the package and the theory of temporal disaggregation.
